Closses Issue #26
Through settings -> Repository -> Push Rules -> Prohibited File 
Names
https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/push_rules/#prohibit-files-by-name

It only takes regex and I think the expression (logo||LOGO) should be fine. It would prevent any logo files from being pushed to the repo. But anyone could change the Prohibited File Names regex. 

Alternatively, 
Through Project_19 -> logo.png -> lock (upper right)
https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/file_lock/

We could use locks instead. Which would still allow the person who holds the lock to edit the logo.

More complex rules can be made with hooks.

We might need hooks or locks in the future but a prohibited name works fine here. We aren't changing it atm. If that's alright with everyone I'll set it up.
