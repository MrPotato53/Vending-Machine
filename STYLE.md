# Styling
For keeping styling consistent for this project we will be using [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) which contains base [rules](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#airflow-air) for python development. Any rules that are ignored from the base set of rules will be listed in the projects ruff.toml file.
